# QMailO

Install QMailO on your server (e. g. Uberspace) to organize your .qmail files.
With it, you can view, add, edit and delete .qmail files.
You can use the API to write your own scripts or frontend, or use the corresponding [Angular frontend](https://github.com/kiwikern/qmailo-frontend).

## Setup
 
 * Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/kiwikern/qmailo.git`
 * `cd qmailo`
 * Run `node src/setup.js` (Make sure, you are in the root directory `qmailo`.)
 * Run `npm start` to start the server. 
 * If you're using it on Ubserspace, you can also [add it as an service](https://wiki.uberspace.de/system:daemontools).
